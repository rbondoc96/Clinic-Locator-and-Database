I came up with this project as a means to rework a location finder tool used at my current job to locate medical clinics. I aim to add more functionality, and allow more valuable information to be readily shared and updated.<br>

The CLDB will allow the user(s) to:
- Search for nearby locations based on locational data (street/city/state, or zip code).
- Filter through the Location Query based on:
  - Services Offered
  - Location Category
  - Days Open
- Add locations to the database
- Update location information and track when/who made the updates
- ~~View up to the past 3 records of the clinic information since the current update~~ (later)
- Rate locations and leave reviews

The goal of this project is to make this information more centralized, convenient, and reliable at work, so we that we can reduce the amount of time spent calling all around asking clinics for information.
