<h3 align="center">Clinic Locator and Database</h3>

---

<p align="center">
I came up with this project as a means to rework a location finder tool used at my current job to find medical clinics. The one we currently have is extremely outdated, and doesn't store enough information or have enough capability to make it as useful it could be.<br>

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The CLDB will allow the user(s) to:
- Search and filter through a database of locations based on address (street, city, state), zip code, services offered by the clinic, and days of operation.
- Add locations to the database
- Update location information as clinics change them and to know when it was last updated and by who
- View up to the past 3 records of the clinic information since the current update
- Give ratings based on the experiences that they had when interacting with the clinic

The goal of this project is to make this information more centralized, convenient, and reliable at work, so we that we can reduce the amount of time spent calling all around asking clinics for information.
